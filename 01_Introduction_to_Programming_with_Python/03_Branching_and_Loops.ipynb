You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Branching with `if`, `else` and `elif`\n\nOne of the most powerful features of programming languages is *branching*: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n\n### The `if` statement\n\nIn Python, branching is implemented using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:\n\n```\nif condition:\n    statement1\n    statement2\n```\n\nThe `condition` can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed. Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n\n> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on *indentation* (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n\n\nFor example, let's write some code to check and print a message if a given number is even.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"a_number = 34","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"if a_number % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"We're inside an if block\")\n    print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We use the modulus operator `%` to calculate the remainder from the division of `a_number` by `2`.

Examples include values of different data types, arithmetic expressions, conditions, variables, function calls, conditional expressions, etc. \n\n\nMost expressions can be executed as statements, but not all statements are expressions. For example, the regular `if` statement is not an expression since it does not evaluate to a value. It merely performs some branching in the code. Similarly, loops and function definitions are not expressions (we'll learn more about these in later sections).\n\nAs a rule of thumb, an expression is anything that can appear on the right side of the assignment operator `=`.

This feature is often referred to as *iteration* on *looping*, and there are two ways to do this in Python: using `while` loops and `for` loops. \n\n`while` loops have the following syntax:\n\n```\nwhile condition:\n    statement(s)\n```\n\nStatements in the code block under `while` are executed repeatedly as long as the `condition` evaluates to `True`. Generally, one of the statements under `while` makes some change to a variable that causes the condition to evaluate to `False` after a certain number of iterations.\n\nLet's try to calculate the factorial of `100` using a `while` loop. The factorial of a number `n` is the product (multiplication) of all the numbers from `1` to `n`, i.e., `1*2*3*...*(n-2)*(n-1)*n`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result = 1\ni = 1\n\nwhile i <= 100:\n    result = result * i\n    i = i+1\n\nprint('The factorial of 100 is: {}'.format(result))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here's how the above code works:\n\n* We initialize two variables, `result` and, `i`. `result` will contain the final outcome. And `i` is used to keep track of the next number to be multiplied with `result`. Both are initialized to 1 (can you explain why?)\n\n* The condition `i <= 100` holds true (since `i` is initially `1`), so the `while` block is executed.\n\n* The `result` is updated to `result * i`, `i` is increased by `1` and it now has the value `2`.\n\n* At this point, the condition `i <= 100` is evaluated again. Since it continues to hold true, `result` is again updated to `result * i`, and `i` is increased to `3`.\n\n* This process is repeated till the condition becomes false, which happens when `i` holds the value `101`. Once the condition evaluates to `False`, the execution of the loop ends, and the `print` statement below it is executed. \n\nCan you see why `result` contains the value of the factorial of 100 at the end? If not, try adding `print` statements inside the `while` block to print `result` and `i` in each iteration.\n\n\n> Iteration is a powerful technique because it gives computers a massive advantage over human beings in performing thousands or even millions of repetitive operations really fast. With just 4-5 lines of code, we were able to multiply 100 numbers almost instantly. The same code can be used to multiply a thousand numbers (just change the condition to `i <= 1000`) in a few seconds.\n\nYou can check how long a cell takes to execute by adding the *magic* command `%%time` at the top of a cell.
