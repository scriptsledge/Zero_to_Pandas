[First Steps with Python and Jupyter](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/first-steps-with-python)\n2. [A Quick Tour of Variables and Data Types](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-variables-and-data-types)\n3. [Branching using Conditional Statements and Loops](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-branching-and-loops)\n\n\nAs you go through this notebook, you will find the symbol **???** in certain places. To complete this assignment, you must replace all the **???** with appropriate values, expressions or statements to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end. \n\n**Guidelines**\n\n1. Make sure to run all the code cells, otherwise you may get errors like `NameError` for undefined variables.\n2. Do not change variable names, delete cells or disturb other existing code. It may cause problems during evaluation.\n3. In some cases, you may need to add some code cells or new statements before or after the line of code containing the **???**. \n4. Since you'll be using a free online service for code execution, save your work by running `jovian.commit` at regular intervals.\n5. Questions marked **(Optional)** will not be considered for evaluation, and can be skipped. They are for your learning.\n6. If you are stuck, you can ask for help on the course forum. Post errors, ask for hints and help others, but **please don't share the full solution answer code** to give others a chance to write the code themselves.\n7. After submission your code will be tested with some hidden test cases. Make sure to test your code exhaustively to cover all edge cases.\n\n\nImportant Links:\n\n* Make submissions here: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/assignment-1-python-basics-practice\n\n* Get help on the community forum: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/assignment-1-python-practice/7761 .
